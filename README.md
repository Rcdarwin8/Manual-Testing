# Testing

**Manual Testing**

Manual testing is a software testing process where test cases are executed manually by a tester without using any automated tools. The goal is to identify bugs, defects, and issues in the software application.

**Steps to Follow:**

* Project Introduction
* Review & Analyze the Requirement/Functionality - FRS
* Prepare Test Plan
* Create Test Scenario
* Create Test Cases, Review, Requirement Tracebility Matrix (RTM)
* Test Environment Setup
* Build Deployment
* Test Execution
* Bug Reporting & Tracking
* Smoke testing (smoke testing), Sanity Testing, Re-Testing, Regression Testing
* Test Phase Sign Off

# Aspects of Manual Testing
 **Importance of Manual Testing:**  Manual testing is crucial for finding critical bugs that automated tests might miss. It allows testers to explore the software from a user's perspective, ensuring a positive user experience.

 **Test Case Design:**  Effective test cases are essential for comprehensive testing.  They should cover various scenarios and edge cases to ensure thorough validation of the software.

 **Testing Techniques:** Different testing techniques, such as exploratory testing, usability testing, and boundary value analysis, are used in manual testing to uncover different types of defects.

 **Documentation:**  Proper documentation of test cases and their results is vital for tracking progress and reporting bugs to the development team.

 **Collaboration:**  Effective communication between testers and developers is key to resolving issues quickly and efficiently.

**Why Manual Testing is still relevant:**

Even with the rise of automation, manual testing remains essential due to its ability to handle complex scenarios, provide user-centric feedback, and adapt to changing requirements.  It complements automated testing by covering areas that are difficult or impossible to automate.
